```
Describe the boot camp: was it useful, difficult, simple?
	Absolutely useful.  I'm pretty sure my brain is completely fully now.  While it was definitely the hardest course I've ever taken it was also by far the most hands on and complete.

Which topic was least familiar to you? Which topic was most familiar?
	The kerberos information was completely new to me.  Administration of mysql was the most familiar.
	
Which topic did you feel was most helpful? Which topic was not useful, if any?
	Honestly it was all helpful.  All of it was either new or reenforced material I needed reenforcement on.

How long before you are ready to to install a production cluster by yourself? What do you need to work on?
	I'd be most comfortable shadowing/working with someone else the first time through.  I do fairly well in a "drop in the deep end" situation but I would like further hands on experience before I am on my own/the only lead.  Specifically I need to work on security and general linux admin/tuning stuff.
